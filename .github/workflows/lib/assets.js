// What `finalize` checks before it flips a release from draft to public.
//
// Until this existed, the only thing between that flip and a release with no
// artifacts on it was finalize's own `needs:` list. A `needs:` list is a
// generated line in a generated file, and losing it does not fail: finalize
// simply stops waiting and publishes a release whose .deb was never uploaded.
// Nothing goes red, because nothing went wrong -- it just did not wait.
//
// Ordering cannot report its own absence. An assertion can, and it cannot pass
// while being wrong: either the asset is on the release or it is not.

// A pattern is an asset name in which `*` stands for any run of characters --
// `*.deb`, `smtp-proxy-*-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`. Deliberately not a full
// glob: the only thing that varies between releases is the version, and `*` is
// enough for it. A literal name would be the second place the version is
// written down, and it would go red on every release that did not update it.

// The expected patterns that nothing on the release satisfies, in the order
// they were declared. Empty means the release carries everything it should.
//
// Note what this does NOT do: it never complains about an asset it did not
// expect. A repository that attaches something extra by hand is not broken,
// and a guard that failed on it would train people to route around finalize.
